# üê∏ frogmpeg

A simple lightweight GUI frontend for ffmpeg.

## Goal

The goal of frogmpeg is to create visual aid for composing ffmpeg commands.

This includes:

- Being able to see where in the video certain timestamps are at
- Being able to position things visually

A secondary goal is to provide memos and helpful snippets for doing common tasks,
so you don't have to use google every time you want to do something.

## Non-goal

To be a proper video editor. Use something else if you need something more complex
than what you are able to sensibly express with an ffmpeg command line.
